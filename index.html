            <p>
              When I started coding DSJ 11 with React, I found the app layout
              complicated. Unlike traditional JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, React
              requires breaking down the interface into components with specific
              syntax. Since I was new to React, I often felt like I was diving
              into unknown waters. Planning the basic layout and hierarchy of a
              React application was a new challenge for me, especially with my
              limited experience in managing components. Despite these
              challenges, I worked hard to overcome them. A major milestone was
              successfully fetching and displaying the shows and their names,
              which made the process clearer and boosted my confidence. The
              panel review presentation was a valuable learning experience. I
              realized that it's important to stay alert, avoid rushing, and
              approach tasks systematically. This change in mindset helped me
              overcome my initial fears and tackle the project with confidence.
              With these insights, I learned to manage my fears and approach
              each step of the project calmly and effectively. This not only
              improved my productivity but also enhanced my problem-solving
              skills. I now understand that developing applications with React
              requires effort and a clear process. With these lessons, I believe
              I am ready to face future jobs with confidence and poise.
