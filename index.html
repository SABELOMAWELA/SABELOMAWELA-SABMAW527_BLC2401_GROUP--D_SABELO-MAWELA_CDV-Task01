                When I started coding Dsj 11 with React, I found the app layout
                complicated. Unlike traditional JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, React
                requires breaking down the interface into components with
                specific syntax. Since I was new to React, I often felt like I
                was diving into unknown waters. Planning the basic layout and
                hierarchy of a React application was a new challenge for me,
                especially with my limited experience in managing components.
                Despite these challenges, I worked hard to overcome them. A
                major milestone was successfully fetching and displaying the
                shows and their names, which made the process clearer and
                boosted my confidence. The panel review presentation was a
                valuable learning experience. I realized that it's important to
                stay alert, avoid rushing, and approach tasks systematically.
                This change in mindset helped me overcome my initial fears and
                tackle the project with confidence. With these insights, I
                learned to manage my fears and approach each step of the project
                calmly and effectively. This not only improved my productivity
                but also enhanced my problem-solving skills. I now understand
                that developing applications with React requires effort and a
                clear process. With these lessons, I believe I am ready to face
                future jobs with confidence and poise.
